JBMessage
=========

JBMessage is simple iOS networking wrapper based on AFNetworking. It allows you to simplify your networking code and forces you to rearrange each API call into separate class.

### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like JBMessage in your projects.

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'JBMessage', '~> 1.0'
```
